# Pepperobfuscator
PepperOBF is a Discord bot that obfuscates Luau code into randomized numeric slash format (numbers 1-90 separated by slashes). Supports inline code or `.lua`/`.txt` file uploads and returns obfuscated Lua with a built-in decoder. Easy to use via slash and prefix commands for Roblox script protection.
